Hello, World!

It's pretty cheesy, I know.  But given my untraditional path into the coding world, it gives me a sense of comradery to start in the same way as so many others before me.  Last Monday I started Flatiron School's Online Software Engineering Bootcamp.  Given that I'm going to be documenting my latest journey, introducing myself and letting you know how I got to this moment seems like the logical place to start. 

Hi!  I'm Lana!

Way back in 2004, I received my BS after majoring in Radio/TV/Film and minoring in Theatre.  Practical, I know.  But a week after I graduated, I moved to Los Angeles and put that ridiculous degree to good use.  I worked free-lance in reality television post-production for 12.5 years.  I was lucky enough to be able to skip being a PA and started right away as an assistant editor.  When I was promoted to a video editor position I was able to stretch my creative legs, crafting stories for a variety of different reality television shows and networks.
I loved it.  
I was great at it.  
But life happened.  
I met my husband, we got married, were starting a family, and all of a sudden the 10 hour work days (minimum...12 – 15 + hour work days more often than I'd like to admit, sometimes 7 days a week) seemed long.  Add to that the fact that we didn't want to raise kids in the social culture of LA, and we decided that we would be willing to sacrifice my career for a better life for our family.  As luck would have it, my husband was offered a transfer to Madison, WI a week after our son was born.  We jumped at the chance to get back to our mid-western roots and into a more family friendly environment.  

I spent about a year at home with my son, during which time I decided that I am absolutely NOT destined to be a stay-at-home mom. 

Just over a year ago, I started my second career as a cabinetry sales and design specialist at a building supply that was opening a location in a new market.  Having never worked in sales before, it was a definite change of pace.  I built partnerships with contractors and helped homeowners make the homes of their dreams.  
The company was amazing.  
I was surprisingly good at it.  
But my family is looking toward the future.  

So here I am, starting over AGAIN.
The thing I loved about my other jobs was that I got to try to solve puzzles all day long.  I've decided to learn how to code and become a software engineer because I think it suits my personality and curiosity.  I chose to do a bootcamp vs. getting another full on degree for two main reasons.  First, I've already gotten one degree.  I know what that entails and I have obligations to my family.  Plus, four years (Heck!  Two years even!) is a long time to wait when you're switching careers.  Secondly, after earning my first degree, probably 90% of what I regularly used, I learned while on the job.  For my second career, probably 90% of what I regularly used, I learned while on the job.  I think having an excellent base and a willingness to keep learning helped me thrive in both of those situations.  Flatiron will give me that base, the rest is up to me.

As for tid-bits about me personally?  I like to cook and crochet, and those are probably the “girliest” things about me.  I enjoy tea, a good craft beer, dark comedies, and crappy sci-fi movies.  I believe pie is better than cake and any food with the word “cream” in the name just should.not.be.diet.  As for the obligatory Mom-ism:

Being a parent, I generally feel like I'm just blundering through and have no idea what I'm doing.  Every once in a while, though, there's a moment when I feel like we're doing something right.  One of those happened earlier this week when I was having a conversation with my little monster in the bathroom (where all good conversations with toddlers take place...):

Little Monster: “Mama, we yucky.”

Me:  “Yucky?!  Are you dirty?  Where are you dirty?”

LM:  “No!  YUCKY!!!  Yucky.  I yucky.  You yucky.  Daddy yucky.”

Me:  “Yucky?  ...You mean lucky???”

LM:  “Yeah!”  (Nods emphatically with the absolute, stubborn conviction only a toddler can muster.)  “We yucky.”

Me:  “You're right, Buddy!  We are lucky.”

And as I start this new journey, that's exactly how I feel.  Lucky to have my family's support.  Lucky to have this opportunity.  Lucky to see challenges as opportunities.  Just lucky.

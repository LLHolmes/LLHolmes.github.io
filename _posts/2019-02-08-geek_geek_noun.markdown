[Dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/geek) has 5 definitions for the word geek.  Today, I am particularly interest in #2: a person who has excessive enthusiasm for and some expertise about a specialized subject or activity.

Hi there.  Nice to meet you.  I'm a geek!

To prove it to you, I'm going to share the first of my Flatiron final projects, the CLI Data Gem Portfolio Project: SpellworkCli.  It's a command line interface to help you view basic information on all known Harry Potter spells using the lovely collection of spells on the [fandom website](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_spells).  

* Disclaimer: To my fellow Potterfiles out there, I know...SpellworkCli is not a comprehensive list of ALL the information on ALL the Harry Potter spells.  Don't be disappointed, it's not “The Standard Book of Spells”.  It's meant to be a quick reference for basic information like the name, description, and how to cast the spell (if the incantation is known).

But, alas, this blog isn't here for the “Quibbler” reading crowd, it's here for computer geeks!  I don't think I've earned the right to call myself one of those yet, but this project has brought me one step closer.

I'm going to be honest, the scariest and most frustrating part of this project for me was the first step.  No, not the notion of a blank canvas, an empty abyss staring me in the face.  My first career as a reality television editor prepared me for that – every new show started with an empty timeline and it was up to me to create interesting television out of seemingly nothing...  No, that emptiness was nothing but possibilities!  The worst part was literally the first step: setting up the gem.  It was the first time I was working off the safety net of Learn.co.  Add some technical difficulties which led to the need to set up a local environment for the first time as well to my general confusion, and day 1 of this project ended with extreme frustration and a gem that was kinda-sorta-almost set up but not at all working.  Sitting here right now, I can't remember how I fixed it and have no idea if I did it correctly, but hey!  My project works, so that's a win, right???

Implimenting the object orientation was fun, scraping the website was engaging, and setting up the command line was a precise, finicky job that left my OCD side extremely satisfied.  But gems!  Ugh!  I'm not sure why, but gems / Bundler / repositories / libraries just turn my brain to static.  I eventually got comfortable using the basics of git, so that's a step in the right direction.  I'm hoping more practice will make all of that background stuff (that I'm pretty sure isn't supposed to be a challenge) into second nature.

At the moment though, I'm pretty darn proud of my first ever gem!  I'm even more excited about some ideas I have for extending and refactoring the code!  That's for another day though.  For now, grab a butterbeer and check out my [spellwork_cli](https://github.com/LLHolmes/spellwork_cli).  I'd love to hear how to improve it!

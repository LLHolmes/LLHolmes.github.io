When I was in 8th grade, I took my first Spanish class. Not because I wanted to, but because I had to. (Way back then, college admissions required you to have two foreign language credits.) I then spent the next three and a half years hoping they would change those requirements. They didn't. So my last semester my senior year of high school I begrudgingly took my second Spanish class. This actually ended up working in my favor since I took my entrance exams immediately after finishing this class. I squeaked out a high enough foreign language score that if I took a couple of math classes and a handful of science lab, I could get a BS (vs a BA) and I would never have to take another Spanish class again. Sounded like a fair trade to me! And that's the story of why I gradated with a Radio/TV/Film major, Theatre minor, and a Bachelor of Science degree.

When I started my FlatIron Rails with JavaScript Project on Monday morning, that’s basically how I felt about all things front-end. 

But this project went surprisingly smooth. And a strange thing happened mid-day on Wednesday when I was putting together the JavaScript for my project show page. I found that I was legitimately enjoying myself!

The requirements for our 4th FlatIron project were straight forward and were entirely focused on building a JavaScript front-end for our last Rails project.  As long as I was doing front-end work, I figured I should actually clean up my HTML and explore CSS a bit more.  Well, the JavaScript feels pretty good, the HTML is functional (I mean, how sexy can it get really?), and the CSS is…better than it was.  There are some things I definitely want to fix, but for my first real try I think the CSS turned out ok.

Overall, this project was more fun than I thought it would be.  Don’t get me wrong!  I’m still solidly on Team Back-End, but I found myself getting carried away a bit with the JavaScript, and for me that’s always a good thing!

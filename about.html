<p>I’m a reality tv editor turned programmer living by the motto “A ship in harbor is safe, but that is not what ships are built for.” (John A. Shedd). I just wrapped up my training at Flatiron School and I’m excited to combine my new software engineering skills with my years of experience interfacing with clients, piecing together puzzles, and clarifying chaos to build technology that will help real people simplify the chaos of their own lives.</p>
